<p><div class="idk"> Stealing </h1> </div><br>
<div class="bodystuff">Stealing a ball from the player is one of the hardest and beneficial in the game. Stealing is hard because you might end up<br>
fouling the player if you don't time the moment right. Fouling the player will give them a chance to have a more organized<br>
plan. So the way you should try to steal the ball is when the player is agressive and tries to make the point. <br>
You should also be cautious and predict the most possiblee moves the player can make, so you have the right timing and spot<br>
for stealing the ball.
